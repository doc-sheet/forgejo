# Sustainability

Forgejo depends on resources to keep going in a durable way and the most precious is the time people spent working on it. Most volunteers may not be inclined to account for the number of hours they spent working on organizing a videoconference, discussing a particular governance issue or implementing a feature. But those who are provide a valuable insight regarding the durability of Forgejo: when cumulated with the time spent by paid staff working along them, it is good approximation of what it costs.

For instance when one person is paid to spend four weeks working on a feature alongside a volunteer, that's at least 300 hours of work total, probably more if they are passionate and work long hours. In 2022 the salary of the person who is paid will vary between 5,000€ and 10,000€ depending on the country they live in and their level of expertise. And while volunteers are, by definition, not paid for their contribution it does not mean their time is less valuable.

All other costs running Forgejo are significantly lower, just like any other Free Software project. The hosting costs rely on donations to Codeberg e.V. which keep Codeberg.org running. Donations to Forgejo could cover everything else: hardware, travel costs etc.
