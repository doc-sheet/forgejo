# Governance

## Codeberg e.V. stewards of the domains

The Forgejo [domains](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/meta/issues/41) are owned by the democratic non-profit dedicated to Free Software [Codeberg e.V.](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/org/src/branch/main/en/bylaws.md). Forgejo is therefore ultimately under the control of Codeberg e.V. and its governance. However, although Codeberg e.V. is committed to use and host Forgejo, it is expected that Forgejo defines its own governance, in a way that is compatible with the Codeberg e.V. governance.

## Interim Forgejo Governance

Although Codeberg e.V. guarantees Forgejo is ultimately under the control of a trusted organization, there was a need to establish an interim Forgejo governance for safeguarding credentials, enforcing the Code of Conduct and ensuring security vulnerabilities are handled responsibly for the Forgejo releases.

All people with a role in the interim Forgejo governance pledge to resign as soon as the Forgejo governance is in place.

* [release managers](https://codeberg.org/org/forgejo/teams/releases) safeguard the keys used to sign Forgejo releases
* [secret keepers](https://codeberg.org/org/Forgejo/teams/owners) safeguard all credentials (registrar, social accounts, etc.)
* [security team](https://codeberg.org/org/forgejo/teams/security) handle security vulnerabilities
* [Well Being](https://codeberg.org/org/forgejo/teams/well-being) and [Moderation](https://codeberg.org/org/forgejo/teams/moderation) teams help keep Forgejo an inclusive space

## Forgejo Governance

Forgejo was bootstraped in November 2022 and is [defining its governance](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/meta/issues/19). The [first meeting happened November 24th](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/meta/issues/19#issuecomment-694460) and was recorded. Everyone is welcome to participate in this fully transparent and cooperative process.
