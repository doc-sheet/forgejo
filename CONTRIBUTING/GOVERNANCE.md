# Governance

## Codeberg e.V. custodian of the domains

The Forgejo [domains](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/meta/issues/41) are owned by the democratic non-profit dedicated to Free Software [Codeberg e.V.](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/org/src/branch/main/en/bylaws.md). Forgejo is therefore ultimately under the control of Codeberg e.V. and its governance. However, although Codeberg e.V. is committed to use and host Forgejo, it is expected that Forgejo defines its own governance, in a way that is compatible with the Codeberg e.V. governance.

## Forgejo Governance

Forgejo was bootstraped in November 2022 and is in the process of [defining its governance](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/meta/issues/19). The [first meeting happened November 24th](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/meta/issues/19#issuecomment-694460) and everyone is welcome to participate.

## Interim Forgejo Governance

While the governance is being defined, there was a need to establish an interim Forgejo governance for safeguarding credentials, enforcing the Code of Conduct and ensuring security vulnerabilities are handled responsibly for the Forgejo releases.

All people with a role in the interim Forgejo governance pledge to resign as soon as the Forgejo governance is in place.

The people and teams that are part of the interim governance are [listed publicly](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/meta/src/branch/readme/TEAMS.md).
