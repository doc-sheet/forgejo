[Added support](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/4449) for third parties to request granular access to resources when Forgejo acts as an [OAuth2 Provider](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/oauth2-provider/). These scopes, previously available only for Personal Access Tokens (PAT), enable users to restrict access to specific URL routes. If Forgejo receives a request with additional scopes known from PAT, it will build granular access following read or write permissions to resources such as Repositories, Issues, ActivityPub, Admin functions, Organizations, Users, Packages, or miscellaneous features.
