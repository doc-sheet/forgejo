There are a couple of new configs to define the name of the instance.
The more important is `APP_SLOGAN`. It permits to configure a slogan for the site.
Its default value is `Beyond coding. We Forge.`
The other new config is `APP_DISPLAY_NAME_FORMAT` and permits to customize the aspect of the full display name for the instance used in some parts of the UI as:

- Title page.
- Homepage head title.
- Open Graph site and title meta tags.

Its default value is `APP_NAME: APP_SLOGAN`.
The introduction of these new configs can break the current presentation of the site title.
