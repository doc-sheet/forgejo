# Welcome to Forgejo

Hi there! Tired of big platforms playing monopoly?
Providing Git hosting for your project, friends, company or community?
**Forgejo** (inspired by forĝejo /ˈfor.d͡ʒe.jo/ – the Esperanto word for *forge*) has you covered with its intuitive interface,
light and easy hosting and a lot of builtin functionality.

Forgejo was forked from the well-known [Gitea](https://gitea.io) project in 2022,
because we think that the project should be owned by an independent community instead of a for-profit company.
If you second that, then Forgejo is for you!
Our promise: **Independent Free/Libre Software forever!**


## What does Forgejo offer?

If you want to know what Forgejo is like,
you can check out public instances<!-- could become link to list -->,

  pull requests, wikis, kanban boards and much more to **coordinate with your team**.
